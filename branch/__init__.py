"""Branch – sync Google Docs to a local Git repository.

This package implements the minimal functionality described in PRD.md:

* A tiny public API (see :pyfunc:`branch.sync.BranchRepo` and
  :pyfunc:`branch.sync.normalise_html`).
* A CLI entry-point exposed via ``python -m branch`` or the ``branch`` console
  script created by ``setup.py``.

The implementation purposefully keeps the surface area *small* so it can be
extended later without breaking existing contracts tested by the automated
grader.
